# API
Web api is used with Dapper for DB queries <br />
Added inline queries as much as possible to finish faster. <br />
Added a one store proc as one example to calll store procs via dapper <br />
Entity framework/Ado.net is also nice to have but dapper is more efficient <br />

# DB
Please see DB diagram in root folder for table deisgns and all scripts are in DBSCripts folder inside Decison Adventure folder <br />
Azure DB is connected via Connection string hardcoded <br />
